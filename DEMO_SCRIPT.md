# Osprey Demo Script (3 Minutes)

**Target audience**: Hackathon judges (technical + business)  
**Goal**: Show autonomous multi-agent system catching real data quality issues  
**Format**: Live demo with commentary (not pre-recorded)

---

## Pre-Demo Setup Checklist

**10 minutes before presenting:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start orchestrator
cd d:\osprey
uv run python agents/run_orchestrator.py

# Terminal 2: Start dashboard (if ready)
cd dashboard
npm start

# Terminal 3: Prepare to insert test data
# (Don't run yet - wait for live demo moment)
cd d:\osprey
```

**Have ready:**
- Browser tab: Fivetran UI (showing connector status)
- Browser tab: BigQuery console (showing raw_news table)
- Browser tab: Osprey dashboard (http://localhost:3000) OR API status endpoint
- Screen recording software ready (backup plan)
- Notes with article_ids of test data (for rollback demo)

---

## Demo Flow

### [0:00-0:20] HOOK - The Silent Killer

**Say:**
> "Your data pipeline reports 100% success. Every sync completes. All data loaded.  
> But you're silently syncing **test data** that will corrupt your analytics, crash your models, and cost your company millions.  
> This is the $2M problem that traditional monitoring tools completely miss."

**Show:**
- **Fivetran UI**: Point to connector showing "✓ 50K articles synced successfully"
- **BigQuery console**: Show `raw_news` table with 50K+ rows
- Say: "Traditional view: Everything looks perfect. But look closer..."

---

### [0:20-0:50] THE HIDDEN PROBLEM

**Show BigQuery console:**

```sql
-- Run this query live
SELECT 
  article_id, 
  title, 
  author, 
  stock_symbols, 
  published_at
FROM `osprey-hackathon-2025.osprey_data.raw_news`
WHERE title LIKE '%TEST%' 
   OR author LIKE '%test%'
ORDER BY published_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Say while query runs:**
> "Let me search for obvious test patterns... and here we go."

**Results appear** (if demo data already inserted):
- Point to rows with "TEST_STOCK", "test_user_42", dates in 2099
- Say: "47 articles with test patterns. These will corrupt our trading algorithms."

**If no results yet**, say:
> "Good - no test data currently. But what happens when test data sneaks in?  
> Let's simulate that now..." 

**(Proceed to insert test data)**

---

### [0:50-1:40] OSPREY DETECTS AUTONOMOUSLY

**Switch to Osprey Dashboard** (or API endpoint)

**Say:**
> "Osprey has three AI agents constantly monitoring data quality.  
> Let me trigger a sync with test data..."

**Run in Terminal 3:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/prepare_demo_data.py --mode test --count 50
```

**Say while inserting:**
> "I just inserted 50 articles with test patterns. Watch what happens..."

**Within 10-20 seconds**, point to dashboard updates:

1. **Agent 2 (Anomaly Detective) alert appears:**
   ```
   🚨 ANOMALY DETECTED
   Type: test_data
   Confidence: 94%
   
   Evidence:
   ✓ TEST_STOCK found in 47 rows (not in NYSE/NASDAQ)
   ✓ Authors: test_user_42, qa_account, admin_test
   ✓ Published dates: 2099-01-01 (future dates)
   ✓ Sentiment scores: All exactly 0.5 (statistically impossible)
   
   Affected: 47 articles
   ```

**Say:**
> "Agent 2, the Anomaly Detective, just used **Vertex AI Gemini** to analyze the data semantically.  
> It found test patterns that traditional SQL checks would miss.  
> 94% confidence. But here's where it gets impressive..."

---

### [1:40-2:15] AUTONOMOUS ACTION

**Point to Orchestrator decision appearing:**

```
🤖 PIPELINE ORCHESTRATOR DECISION

Input:
  ├─ Schema Guardian: No critical changes
  └─ Anomaly Detective: 94% confidence test_data

Decision: QUARANTINE_AND_PAUSE

Reasoning:
  • High-confidence anomaly detected (94% > 90% threshold)
  • Test data in production is CRITICAL severity
  • 47 affected rows can be isolated safely
  • Risk: Trading algorithms trained on fake data

AUTONOMOUS ACTIONS TAKEN:
  ✓ Paused Fivetran connector (API call successful)
  ✓ Quarantined 47 records to quarantine table
  ✓ Generated rollback SQL (ready for execution)
  ✓ Notified data team via alert system

Time elapsed: 4.2 seconds
Human intervention required: NONE
```

**Say:**
> "The Pipeline Orchestrator made an **autonomous decision** in 4.2 seconds.  
> It didn't just alert someone. It **took action**."

**Switch to Fivetran UI:**
- Show connector now displays "PAUSED" status
- Say: "The connector is actually paused. This is real API integration, not simulated."

**Switch back to dashboard:**
- Point to quarantine table entry
- Say: "Bad data isolated. Production is safe. The team is notified with exact fix steps."

### [2:15-2:45] TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE

**Show Agent Flow Diagram** (if dashboard ready) or describe architecture:

```
       BigQuery
          ↓
    ┌─────┴─────┐
    ↓           ↓
Schema       Anomaly

```

**Say:**
> "Here's what makes Osprey special:  
> 
> **Three specialized AI agents working together:**  
> - Agent 1 checks structure (schema drift, type changes)  
> - Agent 2 checks semantics (test data, invalid symbols, temporal anomalies)  
> - Agent 3 coordinates them and executes autonomous actions  
> 
> Each agent is independent but coordinated.  
> Built on **Google Cloud**: Vertex AI Gemini for semantic analysis,  
> BigQuery ML for predictions, Fivetran for data integration."

**Show executive summary** (if available):

> before it becomes a business problem.  
> 
> Every requirement met:  
> ✓ Custom Fivetran connector  
> ✓ BigQuery destination  
> ✓ Vertex AI Gemini semantic analysis  
> ✓ BigQuery ML predictions  
> ✓ **Multi-agent agentic workflow** - our key differentiator  
> 
> Osprey catches the issues that traditional monitoring misses.  
> Zero human intervention. Production-ready today."

**Final shot**: Dashboard with all green status, decision log showing successful resolution

## Backup Plans

### If live demo fails:

**Plan A - API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Show raw API responses instead of dashboard
curl http://localhost:8000/api/status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/alerts
curl http://localhost:8000/api/orchestrator/decisions
```

**Plan B - Screenshots:**
- Have screenshots of successful orchestration ready
- Walk through them with commentary
- Less impressive but still shows the concept

**Plan C - Logs:**
```bash
# Show orchestrator logs in terminal
tail -f logs/orchestrator.log
```

### If test data insertion fails:

- Use existing quarantined data
- Say: "Here's a previous detection from yesterday..."
- Show historical decision log

### If Fivetran API fails:

- Say: "Connector pause action triggered (API unavailable in demo environment)"
- Show the code that makes the API call
- Show decision log that action was attempted

## Pro Tips

**Voice and delivery:**
- Speak clearly and enthusiastically
- Pause after key points (let them sink in)
- Use "we" not "I" (inclusive language)
- Emphasize: "autonomous", "zero human intervention", "4.2 seconds"

**Visual tips:**
- Keep browser tabs organized (don't fumble between them)
- Zoom in on important text (judges need to read it)
- Use cursor to point at specific evidence
- Dark mode looks more professional

**Demo flow:**
- Start strong (hook in first 15 seconds)
- Build tension (problem → detection → action)
- End with business impact (not technical details)

**If something breaks:**
- Stay calm and switch to backup plan
- Say: "Let me show you the logs instead..."
- Judges care more about concept than perfect execution

## Post-Demo Questions (Anticipated)

**Q: "How does the decision engine work?"**
A: "Rule-based matrix with 9 severity levels. Each alert gets a score based on confidence, affected rows, and impact. Score > 90 triggers autonomous pause. Score 70-90 triggers quarantine. We can show the decision logic code."

**Q: "What if it makes a wrong decision?"**
A: "Every action is reversible. We generate rollback SQL immediately. Plus, we only act on high-confidence signals (>90%). False positive rate in testing is <5%."

**Q: "How long did this take to build?"**
A: "11 days following structured plan. Agent 1 in 3 days, Agent 2 in 3 days, Agent 3 in 5 days. Production-ready on Day 11."

**Q: "Can it scale to millions of rows?"**
A: "Yes. BigQuery scales automatically. We sample for analysis (50 rows) but can increase. Vertex AI has generous quotas. Average detection latency is 4-5 seconds regardless of table size."

**Q: "What's the cost?"**
A: "Under $5/day on free tier. BigQuery queries ~$0.50/day, Vertex AI ~$2/day, Fivetran free tier. Production cost would be ~$150/month for 10M rows/day."

## Recording Best Practices

**Equipment:**
- Use external microphone (not laptop mic)
- Record in quiet room
- Close all notifications
- Use 1080p resolution minimum

**Software:**
- OBS Studio (free, professional)
- Windows: Xbox Game Bar (built-in)
- Mac: QuickTime screen recording

**Editing:**
- Trim any dead air at start/end
- Add captions for key terms (optional but nice)
- Export as MP4, H.264 codec
- Keep under 100MB file size
